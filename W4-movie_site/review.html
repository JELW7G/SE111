                <p><b>Joseph Lopez</b> - <i>2/7/2024</i></p>
                <p>The original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie that released in 1993 was Nintendo's first major attempt at a theater movie worldwide, and it went down as one of the most infamous video game adaptations of all time. One of the most prominent issues is that it is supposed a live-action adaptation of the original Super Mario Brothers games, but that is hardly recognizable since the plot of the movie had hardly does anything with its source material besides character names and somewhat passable character designs. It was also a massive commercial flop, having a budget of $42 million and only grossing about $21.3 million, but it also wasn't just a commercial failure- it failed critcally as well, having a 16% on <u>Rotten Tomatoes</u> and a 4.1/10 on <u>IMBD</u>.</p>

                <p>Diving into the plot of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, for being a movie about the Super Mario Bros franchise, not only does it barely take anything from the games, it definitely doesn't make up for the originality that it brings. It starts out in the real world city of Brooklyn, where Mario and Luigi are struggling plumbers before they meet Daisy (not Peach- Peach isn't even in the movie at all). Luigi quickly becomes infatuated with Daisy, but she gets kidnapped by Iggy and Spike and taken to a parallel dimension that- get this- <i><b>was created when the meteorite that hit the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</b></i> In this parallel dimension, President Koopa controls the realm, and his ultimate goal is to unite the two dimension and rule over both of them. It's now up the two brothers to save Daisy and foil the plans of the evil Koopa.</p>
